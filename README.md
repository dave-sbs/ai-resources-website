#### Looking to implement AI tools in your studies or work?

##### The Davis AI resource directory hosts a variety of tools that could be used for multidisciplinary tasks. For each category, we showcase two models we think are the best. They are evaluated across a range of related tasks and we choose the ones with the best performance. Each tool or resrource is accompanied by an example of how to use it, things we like about it, and things to be cautious about when using it.
