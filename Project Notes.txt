Site data is basically a collecction of different CSV and YML files for the websites.
These files are basically the main content of the website

Home Page
- Simplify laout to adjust to our needs
    - Header info in config.YML
    - Navbar info in base.html
    - Home page info in index.html
- Clicking link to a paper takes to a new webpage/html  
    - Minimizing the content in there to our needs
- Add posters to home page
    - What codebases take papers.csv and manipulate the data???
    - Need to reduce the size of posters.
    - Edit the appearance of the poster as well.

Add/Remove Features
    - Do we want Google Analytics? 
    - Do we want Navbar? Yes. 

Background





- So I could either make the poster section a component. Like adapt the code so that it becomes a component or I could integrate it directly to the index.html. 
- I think if I go the component route I would only need to add stuff to the csv and it'll display the new posters depending on the data there. So I think it'll be easier for editing and future use by other people.  
- This is currently a working theory, but the only real use of components is if the same components get reused on multiple pages. 
- Cause I think I could also change csv data to get what I want out of posters code.



Future Changes;
- Background image change: config.YML
- Logo Change: config.YML (Colby logo)? DAI Logo?
- Website link logo change: 
- Make Github link work
- Reduce number of params in CSV: README (sitedata)
- Increase overall width of the content
