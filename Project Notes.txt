Site data is basically a collecction of different CSV and YML files for the websites.
These files are basically the main content of the website

Home Page
- Simplify laout to adjust to our needs
    - Header info in config.YML
    - Navbar info in base.html
    - Home page info in index.html
- Clicking link to a paper takes to a new webpage/html  
    - Minimizing the content in there to our needs
- Add posters to home page
    - What codebases take papers.csv and manipulate the data???
    - Need to reduce the size of posters.
    - Edit the appearance of the poster as well.

Add/Remove Features
    - Do we want Google Analytics? 
    - Do we want Navbar? Yes. 

Background


Comments on design
    - Change the font/Make it more 'friendly'
    - Include the vector images in the style of images on kaggle
    - Include some colors





- So I could either make the poster section a component. Like adapt the code so that it becomes a component or I could integrate it directly to the index.html. 
- I think if I go the component route I would only need to add stuff to the csv and it'll display the new posters depending on the data there. So I think it'll be easier for editing and future use by other people.  
- This is currently a working theory, but the only real use of components is if the same components get reused on multiple pages. 
- Cause I think I could also change csv data to get what I want out of posters code.



Future Changes;
- Background image change: config.YML
- Logo Change: config.YML (Colby logo)? DAI Logo?
- Website link logo change: 
- Make Github link work
- Increase overall width of the content
- Include Images in each model page

This ensures that if any of the software components it relies on are updated or changed, OpenPose is also updated to maintain compatibility and functionality.|The tool provides a way to understand human movements and activities in videos by mapping out body keypoints. This is done without revealing personal, identifiable details about the individuals, preserving their privacy.|The keypoints OpenPose detects in videos have various applications. They can be used in areas like fitness training, sports analysis, studying physical activities, and even in the performing arts, offering a broad range of practical uses.|Despite its benefits, there are some limitations to OpenPose that we should consider:|While OpenPose performs effectively with still images, its performance drops with longer video sequences. It tends to process videos more slowly, which can be a limitation in real-time or lengthy video analysis.|OpenPose excels in analyzing videos with a single person. However, its performance is less reliable in videos with multiple people. It may mix up or misidentify individuals, especially if they move close to each other or overlap in the video frame.
